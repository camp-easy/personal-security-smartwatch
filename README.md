# personal-security-smartwatch

we aim to create an innovative, advanced and complete smartwatch for personal security, efficient and complete in protocols and user interfaces, so we are currently developing a first prototype with the A9G chip, which seems to us suitable for now (gps, gprs, gsm, call, sms, mqtt, http, eccâ€¦), combined with muscolar EMG sensor, ECG sensor, detection of opening, unauthorized by the owner user, of the closure of the smartwatch band, buttons, charger, sim, screen, speaker, microphone and more. Currently the project is in its early stages and we are still a small team of members who study business economics, electronics, computer science and programming at university, and we are young and just starting out, so our plan is to find other members,firmwarists, coders, electronics, computer scientists, join together and collaborate (for example in Google Meet) on the project together: anyone interested or intrigued by the project can freely write to us :)
